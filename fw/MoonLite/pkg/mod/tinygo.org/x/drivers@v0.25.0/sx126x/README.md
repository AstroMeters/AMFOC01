# SX126x LoRa Radio

The Semtech SX126x family of sub-Ghz radio transceivers come in a number of different formats.

SX126x radios have a wide continuous frequency coverage from 150 MHz to 960 MHz.

SX1261 can transmit up to +15 dBm and the SX1262 can transmit up to +22 dBm

Some development boards are specific to a particular frequency range, so for example you need a different variation of that board for EU868 vs. for AU915.
